            <p class="p">Born and raised in Queens NY, I picked a spot on the globe and moved to Seattle in the Summer of 2016 without a job or idea of how Seattle was going to be. I just knew I needed a change from the grind of NYC. </p>  
            <p class="p">I graduated with a Computer Science degree and although I’ve always had a strong artistic pull, I ended up in IT Support (specifically for Macs). Moving out here and finding a job was tough, especially in Microsoft town for a non enterprise Mac guy, but somehow I landed a job that had opportunity to grow. As I developed into a IT Client Engineer I took on challenges with Powershell and automated AD and 365 tasks for my team, as well as special projects. This sparked my artistic tendencies and made me want to create again. That is when I decided to pursue development of some kind and am now taking the UW Full Stack Bootcamp course. Here I am, looking for new opportunities to grow.
            </p>
            <p class="p">Outside of IT, I’ve always enjoyed motorcycling, snowboarding and hunting. Those three took up my life in my mid 20's to late 30’s. These days I prefer traveling and exploring the world.</p>
